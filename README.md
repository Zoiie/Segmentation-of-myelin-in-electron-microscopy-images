# Segmentation-of-myelin-in-electron-microscopy-images
### This project is based on Unet, using Topoloss(base on HU Xiaoling's paper) to improve THE prediction results of Unet. The purpose is to solve the problem of small connection in image segmentation.

### The result images in test_unseen_images.
### Main file is main.py

# Compare the results
### Pictures are in data/compare
### You can find the codes of Hausdorff distance, dice, MSE, SSIM in the followwing file:
### images_compare.py
